## Project Overview

React Neighbourhood App finding nice places to eat in Miami. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). And I utilized Google Maps API and FourSquare API


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Dependencies and Built With
Packages
*Create-react-app
*API
*Google Maps API
*Foursquare API
Design
*Axios 
*Npm and node.js

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Installation and running the project:

1. You can either Zip-Download: Download the repository as a zip-file, extract it, use Git Bash to change into the project directory or
2. Clone the Repository: Clone the repository with Git Bash to a directory of your choice: use ```git clone``` and the url to this repo for example https://github.com/MarthaTaylor/react-map-app-p8 , to double check the url just navigate to the green clone button on the repo choose https and copy the url to use with git clone from within the clone button
3. Next install all the project dependencies cd into the project on git bash and run ```npm install```
start the development server with npm start
4. Ater this run ```npm start``` to start the server in the project. The React App should open automatically in your browser with a url of localhost:3000 keep an eye in git bash to verify what url it advises you to use in your local brwser. If it doesn't open just open a Browser you like and place ```localhost:3000``` in your and hit enter or pass in the url that git bash propmts you too. Note it may take a few minutes for your server to start fully and browser to pen, be patient.
5. React has its own Service-Workers that only work in build-mode, not in the dev-mode. Run ```npm run build``` to build the app.



## Udacity shares extra app information

The folloing pieces of text and infomation have been provided by Udacity:

```npm start```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```npm test```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

```npm run build```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

```npm run eject```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
